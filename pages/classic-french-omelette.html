          Our goal: an enveloping sheet of tender egg cradling a soft-scrambled
          interior

        <p>
          The classic French omelette is a simple yet elegant dish that has been
          enjoyed for centuries. It is made with just a few
          ingredients&mdash;eggs, butter, salt, and pepper&mdash;but it requires
          a delicate touch to achieve the perfect texture. The key is to use
          fresh, high-quality eggs and to cook them over low heat in a nonstick
          pan. The eggs should be beaten just until they are combined, and then
          they should be cooked until they are set but still slightly creamy.
          The omelette should then be folded in half and served immediately.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground white or black pepper</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a medium bowl, beat eggs with a disposable plastic or reusable
            wooden fork just until last traces of white are mixed in; season
            with salt and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a perfectly unscratched 8-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter,
            swirling over moderate heat, until fully melted and foamy but not
            browned. Add eggs and stir rapidly with fork, tines up, while
            shaking pan to agitate eggs; make sure to move fork all around pan
            to break up curds and scrape them from bottom of skillet as they
            form. Stop stirring as soon as eggs are very softly scrambled and
            creamy (but still loose enough to come together into a single mass),
            1 to 2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using fork, gently spread egg in an even layer around skillet and
            scrape down any wispy bits around the edges. The top surface should
            be loose and creamy, but if it looks too liquid and raw, cook
            undisturbed for another few seconds. (If it still flows, you can
            swirl skillet to send loose egg to the edges, where it will set more
            quickly.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from heat, tilt skillet up by its handle, and, using fork,
            gently roll omelette down over itself until it is nearly folded in
            half. Using fork, push omelette to edge of skillet so that lower
            edge of egg begins to just barely overhang; use fork to fold
            overhanging edge of egg up, closing omelette.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hold skillet right over plate and turn omelette out onto it. It
            should be almond- or cigar-shaped, with the seam on bottom; if it's
            not, lay a clean kitchen towel over it and use your hands to adjust
            its shape and position, then remove towel. Serve. (To make another
            omelette, wipe any eggy bits out of skillet and repeat.)
          </li>
        </ol>
