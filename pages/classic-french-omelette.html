        <p>
          The classic French omelette is a simple yet elegant dish that has been
          enjoyed for centuries. It is made with just a few
          ingredients&mdash;eggs, butter, salt, and pepper&mdash;but it requires
          a delicate touch to achieve the perfect texture. The key is to use
          fresh, high-quality eggs and to cook them over low heat in a nonstick
          pan. The eggs should be beaten just until they are combined, and then
          they should be cooked until they are set but still slightly creamy.
          The omelette should then be folded in half and served immediately.
