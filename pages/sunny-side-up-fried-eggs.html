          Your foolproof plan for perfectly golden yolks and tender, just-set
          whites
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sunny-side up fried eggs are a quick and easy breakfast or brunch
          option that is perfect for those who like their eggs with a runny
          yolk. They are made with just a few ingredients&mdash;eggs, butter,
          salt, and pepper&mdash;but they require a delicate touch to achieve
          the perfect texture.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet, melt butter over
            medium heat until lightly foaming, tilting pan to evenly distribute
            the butter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carefully break eggs into the skillet, season with salt, and cover
            with glass lid. Cook until the whites are just set, about 1 minute
            and 30 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove lid, continue to cook for another 1 minute and 30 seconds or
            until whites are completely set and the yolks are still runny.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer to a plate, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve
            immediately.
