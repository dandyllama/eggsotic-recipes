        <p>
          Sunny-side up fried eggs are a quick and easy breakfast or brunch
          option that is perfect for those who like their eggs with a runny
          yolk. They are made with just a few ingredients&mdash;eggs, butter,
          salt, and pepper&mdash;but they require a delicate touch to achieve
          the perfect texture.
