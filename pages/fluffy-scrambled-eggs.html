        <p>
          Fluffy scrambled eggs are a delicious and easy-to-make breakfast or
          brunch dish. They are made with just a few simple
          ingredients&mdash;eggs, butter, milk, salt, and pepper&mdash;but they
          can be customized to your liking with the addition of cheese,
          vegetables, or other herbs and spices.
