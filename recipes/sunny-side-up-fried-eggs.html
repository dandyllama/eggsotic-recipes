            Your foolproof plan for perfectly golden yolks and tender, just-set
            whites
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sunny-side up fried eggs are a quick and easy breakfast or brunch
            option that is perfect for those who like their eggs with a runny
            yolk. They are made with just a few ingredients&mdash;eggs, butter,
            salt, and pepper&mdash;but they require a delicate touch to achieve
            the perfect texture.

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet, melt butter
              over medium heat until lightly foaming, tilting pan to evenly
              distribute the butter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carefully break eggs into the skillet, season with salt, and cover
              with glass lid. Cook until the whites are just set, about 1 minute
              and 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove lid, continue to cook for another 1 minute and 30 seconds
              or until whites are completely set and the yolks are still runny.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer to a plate, season to taste with salt and pepper, and
              serve immediately.
            </li>
          </ol>
