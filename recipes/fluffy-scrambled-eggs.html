            Here's what you need to know: when to salt, what to add, and how hot
            the pan should be

          <p>
            Fluffy scrambled eggs are a delicious and easy-to-make breakfast or
            brunch dish. They are made with just a few simple
            ingredients&mdash;eggs, butter, milk, salt, and pepper&mdash;but
            they can be customized to your liking with the addition of cheese,
            vegetables, or other herbs and spices.
